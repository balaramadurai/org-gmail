#+TITLE: org-gmail: Fetch Gmail Threads into Org Mode

* Introduction

org-gmail is a package for Emacs that allows you to fetch entire Gmail threads or individual messages and save them as entries in your Org mode files. It uses the Gmail API via a companion Python script.

* Features

- Create and delete labels in Gmail.
- Download all emails with a specific label, chosen from a list fetched directly from Gmail.
- Sync all previously downloaded labels to fetch new emails. This works by finding all `:LABEL:` properties in your agenda files, so you can refile and reorganize your emails without breaking the sync.
- Edit a thread's label at point, updating it in Gmail and across all your Org files.
- Bulk move all threads from one label to another. If the destination label doesn't exist, it will be created for you. This updates both Gmail and all corresponding `:LABEL:` properties in your Org files.
- Download new messages for a specific thread.
- Insert new messages directly after the existing thread in your Org file.
- Move messages or entire threads to the trash in Gmail.
- Sync and find duplicate email IDs across your agenda files.
- Create and insert internal links (`org-gmail:`) between email entries. (in progress)
- A Hydra menu for quick access to all commands.

* Use Cases

** Getting Things Done (GTD)

`org-gmail` is a great fit for a GTD workflow. You can process your Gmail inbox and convert actionable emails into Org Mode tasks.

- Process Inbox :: In Gmail, apply a label like `ToProcess` to emails that require action.
- Download :: Use `M-x org-gmail-download-by-label` to pull all emails with the `ToProcess` label into your `index.org` file.
- Refile :: Go through the new entries in your inbox file. For each one, you can:
    -   Add a `TODO` keyword.
    -   Schedule it or set a deadline.
    -   Refile it to the appropriate project file.
    -   Use `M-x org-gmail-edit-label-at-point` to change the label in Gmail (e.g., to `Reference` or `Projects/ProjectName`).

** P.A.R.A. Method

The P.A.R.A. (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method is also well-supported.

-  Labeling :: In Gmail, use labels that match your P.A.R.A. structure (e.g., `1Projects/ClientWebsite`, `2Areas/Finances`, `3Resources/Emacs`).
- Download :: Use `M-x org-gmail-download-by-label` to download emails related to a specific project or area.
- Lifecycle Management :: When a project is finished, use `M-x org-gmail-bulk-move-labels` to move all threads from `1Projects/ClientWebsite` to `4Archives/2025/ClientWebsite`. This automatically updates both Gmail and all the `:LABEL:` properties in your Org files, keeping everything in sync.

* Comparison with Other Emacs Mail Clients

** Gnus, mu4e, notmuch

These are powerful, full-featured email clients inside Emacs. They are designed to manage your entire email workflow: reading, writing, sending, and organizing.

** org-gmail

`org-gmail` is not a replacement for a full mail client. Instead, it's a tool for *integrating* your most important emails into your Org Mode knowledge base.

-   Focus ::  `org-gmail` is focused on pulling email content into Org Mode so it can be linked to tasks, notes, and other parts of your system.
-   Workflow :: The intended workflow is to do your initial email triage in the Gmail web interface (or another client) and then use `org-gmail` to pull in the threads that are relevant to your projects and long-term notes.
-   Strength :: Its strength is its deep integration with Org Mode's structure and linking capabilities, not in managing your day-to-day email flow.
