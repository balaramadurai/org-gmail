#+TITLE: org-gmail: Gmail Meets Org Mode (and they actually get along)

* Why org-gmail?

You love Org Mode. You tolerate email. What if they could work together?

** The Problem

- You already have a great email client (Gmail's web UI is fast)
- You already have a great task/knowledge system (Org Mode)
- But important emails live in one place, and your real work happens in another
- Existing solutions (Gnus, mu4e, notmuch) want to BE your email client—500+ lines of config, all or nothing

** The Solution

=org-gmail= is a *bridge*, not a replacement. It lets you:

1. *Triage in Gmail* — Use the fast web UI for the easy stuff
2. *Process in Org Mode* — Pull important threads where you do real work
3. *Two-way sync* — Changes flow both directions

Think of it as =org-capture= for email, but bidirectional.

** Who Is This For?

- GTD practitioners who want email context in their weekly reviews
- P.A.R.A. users who want Gmail labels mirroring their folder structure
- Anyone who thinks "I wish this email thread was in my Org file"

* Introduction

org-gmail is a package for Emacs that allows you to fetch entire Gmail threads or individual messages and save them as entries in your Org mode files. It uses the Gmail API via a companion Python script.

* Screenshot

* Features

- Create and delete labels in Gmail.
- Download all emails with a specific label, chosen from a list fetched directly from Gmail.
- Sync all previously downloaded labels to fetch new emails. This works by finding all `:LABEL:` properties in your agenda files, so you can refile and reorganize your emails without breaking the sync. You can also configure a list of labels to ignore during this process.
- Edit a thread's label at point, updating it in Gmail and across all your Org files.
- Bulk move all threads from one label to another. If the destination label doesn't exist, it will be created for you. This updates both Gmail and all corresponding `:LABEL:` properties in your Org files.
- Download new messages for a specific thread.
- Insert new messages directly after the existing thread in your Org file.
- Move messages or entire threads to the trash in Gmail.
- Defer (snooze) emails using natural language (e.g., "next monday"). /Note: Gmail API snooze support is limited; see Known Issues./
- Reply to and delegate (forward) emails directly from Emacs, with full control over recipients.
- Create actionable sub-tasks for emails that will appear in your agenda.

* Optional Features (with suggested configuration)

- Create and insert internal links (`org-gmail:`) between email entries (requires `org-ql`).
- A Hydra menu for quick access to all commands (requires `hydra`).

* Installation

** 1. Python Dependencies

This package relies on a Python script with a few dependencies. You can install them using pip:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib html2text pytz
#+END_SRC

**Note on the `snooze` feature:** The Gmail API does not officially expose a public snooze endpoint. The =defer= command may not work as expected. See [[https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109952618][this feature request]] for updates from Google.

** 2. Gmail API Credentials

You'll need to enable the Gmail API and download a `credentials.json` file.

1. Go to the [[https://console.developers.google.com/][Google Cloud Console]].
2. Create a new project.
3. Enable the "Gmail API" for your project.
4. Create credentials for a "Desktop app".
5. Download the `credentials.json` file.

** 3. Emacs Package Installation

This package is designed to be installed with `straight.el`. Add the following to your Emacs configuration. Make sure to replace `"your-username/your-repo-name"` with your actual GitHub repository details.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-gmail
    :straight (org-gmail :type git :host github :repo "balaramadurai/org-gmail")

* Use Cases

** Getting Things Done (GTD)

`org-gmail` is a great fit for a GTD workflow. You can process your Gmail inbox and convert actionable emails into Org Mode tasks.

1.  **Process Inbox:** In Gmail, apply a label like `ToProcess` to emails that require action.
2.  **Download:** Use `M-x org-gmail-download-by-label` to pull all emails with the `ToProcess` label into your `index.org` file.
3.  **Refile:** Go through the new entries in your inbox file. For each one, you can:
    -   **Delete:** If it's not needed, use `M-x org-gmail-trash-at-point`.
    -   **Defer:** If it's not actionable now, use `M-x org-gmail-defer-at-point` to snooze it.
    -   **Do (Reply):** If it takes less than 2 minutes, reply directly with `M-x org-gmail-reply-at-point`.
    -   **Delegate:** If it's for someone else, forward it with `M-x org-gmail-delegate-at-point`.
    -   **To-Do:** If it's a larger task, use `M-x org-gmail-add-action-at-point` to create a `TODO` sub-task that will appear in your agenda.

** P.A.R.A. Method

The P.A.R.A. (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) method is also well-supported.

1.  **Labeling:** In Gmail, use labels that match your P.A.R.A. structure (e.g., `1Projects/ClientWebsite`, `2Areas/Finances`, `3Resources/Emacs`).
2.  **Download:** Use `M-x org-gmail-download-by-label` to download emails related to a specific project or area.
3.  **Lifecycle Management:** When a project is finished, use `M-x org-gmail-bulk-move-labels` to move all threads from `1Projects/ClientWebsite` to `4Archives/2025/ClientWebsite`. This automatically updates both Gmail and all the `:LABEL:` properties in your Org files, keeping everything in sync.

* Comparison with Other Emacs Mail Clients

** Gnus, mu4e, notmuch

These are powerful, full-featured email clients inside Emacs. They are designed to manage your entire email workflow: reading, writing, sending, and organizing.

*Short answer:* They're amazing. Use them if they work for you.

*The honest answer:*
- They want to BE your email client
- They require ~500 lines of config (minimum)
- They struggle with Gmail's labels and threading
- They make you choose: "All in Emacs" or nothing

** org-gmail

=org-gmail= says: "Why not both?"

It is not a replacement for a full mail client. Instead, it's a *bridge* for integrating your most important emails into your Org Mode knowledge base.

| Feature | Gnus/mu4e/notmuch | org-gmail |
|---------+-------------------+-----------|
| Goal | Full email client | Gmail ↔ Org bridge |
| Config | 500+ lines | ~20 lines |
| Gmail labels | Partial support | Native support |
| Offline | Yes | No (API required) |
| All email | Yes | Selected threads |
| Org integration | Links only | Full properties, sync |

** What org-gmail Is NOT

- A full email client
- A replacement for Gnus/mu4e/notmuch
- A way to read ALL your email in Emacs
- Offline-capable

** What org-gmail IS

- A bridge between Gmail and Org Mode
- A way to manage important email threads in Org
- A GTD/P.A.R.A. power tool
- ~800 lines of Python + ~600 lines of Elisp
- Usable in 10 minutes, powerful for years

* FAQ

/Questions from the [[https://emacsconf.org/2025/talks/gmail/][EmacsConf 2025]] community. See the [[https://pad.emacsconf.org/2025-gmail][discussion pad]] for more./

** How does it handle attachments?

Currently, attachments are not downloaded. The email body (text/HTML converted to Org) is fetched, but attachments remain in Gmail. You can click the Gmail link in the entry to access them.

*Future plans:* Attachment support is on the roadmap—likely downloading to a configurable directory with Org links to the files.

** Do I need to know all my contacts' email addresses?

For replies, the =FROM=, =TO=, and =CC= fields are pre-filled from the original email's properties. You can edit them interactively before sending. There's no built-in contact list, but completion could integrate with =BBDB= or similar in the future.

** Can I use this with non-Gmail providers (FastMail, etc.)?

Not directly. =org-gmail= is built specifically on the Gmail API for its native label and threading support.

However, the *Org Mode integration patterns* could be adapted. For non-Gmail setups, consider:
- [[https://github.com/gauteh/lieer][lieer]] — Gmail to Maildir sync (works with notmuch)
- [[https://github.com/elizagamedev/mujmap][mujmap]] — JMAP to Maildir (works with FastMail)
- [[https://github.com/JasonSKK/notmuch-lieer-sync][notmuch-lieer-sync]] — notmuch + lieer integration

The Python backend could potentially be adapted for other APIs (Outlook Graph API, JMAP) in the future.

** Do I risk sending emails to the wrong person?

=org-gmail= is designed for *pulling email into Org* for task management, not as a primary email client. For critical communications:
- Reply recipients are shown and editable before sending
- Use Gmail's web UI for high-stakes messages
- The tool is best for managing project context, not mission-critical sending

** What's the main goal of org-gmail?

The core goal is *an easier way to add emails into Org Mode and Org Agenda workflows*. It's not trying to replace your email client—it's trying to make email part of your knowledge management system.

Think of it as: triage in Gmail, process in Org, stay in sync.

** Will there be headers visible when composing replies?

Good feedback! Currently the reply buffer is minimal. Adding visible headers (like =message-mode=) is a reasonable enhancement for a future version.

* Known Issues

- *Snooze/Defer:* The Gmail API does not officially expose snooze functionality. The =org-gmail-defer-at-point= command may fail with an =AttributeError=. This is a [[https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109952618][known limitation]] of the Gmail API.
- *Rate Limits:* Downloading very large labels (10k+ emails) may hit Gmail API rate limits.
- *OAuth Token Expiry:* In "test mode", tokens expire after 7 days. Publish your app for longer-lived tokens.
- *Attachments:* Not currently downloaded (see FAQ).
